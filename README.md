# [Saitama's Backstory](https://readonepunch-man.com/saitama-one-punch-man/)

Saitama's backstory is marked by simplicity and humor, contrasting sharply with the elaborate origins of many anime heroes. Initially, he was an ordinary young man struggling to find a job. His life took a dramatic turn when he encountered Crablante, a crab-human mutant, who was terrorizing a ball-chinned boy. Despite having no powers at the time, Saitama's sense of justice compelled him to protect the child, leading to a fierce battle that ignited his passion for heroism.

This encounter was a catalyst for Saitama's transformation. Determined to become a hero, he embarked on an extreme training regimen consisting of 100 push-ups, 100 sit-ups, 100 squats, and a 10-kilometer run every day. He adhered to this routine rigorously for three years, a commitment so intense that it caused him to lose all his hair. This unorthodox training method, though seemingly absurd, resulted in Saitama gaining unprecedented strength, enabling him to defeat any opponent with a single punch.

Saitama's backstory is a deliberate parody of typical hero narratives. Unlike other protagonists who undergo profound trials and tribulations, Saitama's journey to becoming the strongest hero is straightforward and almost mundane. His origin story serves as a humorous critique of the genre, emphasizing that his extraordinary power stems from sheer determination and an unconventional training routine, rather than from a complex or tragic past.

In the [One Punch Man manga](https://sites.google.com/view/allthingsonepunchman/home), this origin story is highlighted with great detail, showcasing the contrast between Saitama and characters like Genos, whose backstories are filled with tragedy and elaborate transformations. Whether you're reading about Saitama's initial struggles or his eventual rise to heroism, the humor and simplicity of his journey stand out, making the One Punch Man anime a unique and entertaining critique of traditional superhero narratives.
